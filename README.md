# Python Car Game

This is a simple car game implemented in Python using the Pygame library.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Pygame library

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-game.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd car-game
   ```

3. **Run the game:**

   ```bash
   python car_game.py
   ```

## Usage

- Use the 'W' key to accelerate forward and the 'S' key to decelerate.
- Use the 'A' and 'D' keys to steer left and right respectively.
- Avoid collisions with the border and obstacles.

## To-Do List

- Implement a Deep Q Network (DQN) to enable autonomous driving. This involves:
  - Researching and understanding the principles of reinforcement learning.
  - Designing and training a neural network model using DQN.
  - Integrating the trained model into the game environment to enable autonomous driving.
  - Tuning hyperparameters and optimizing the model's performance.
- Enhance the user interface and game features:
  - Add a main menu screen with options for starting the game, accessing settings, and exiting.
  - Implement customizable settings such as sound effects volume, screen resolution, and key bindings.
  - Introduce additional gameplay elements such as power-ups, different car models, and dynamic obstacles.
- Improve collision detection and physics simulation:
  - Refine collision detection algorithms to accurately detect collisions between the car and obstacles.
  - Enhance the physics simulation to provide more realistic movement and interactions between objects.
  - Implement advanced features such as vehicle damage, tire traction, and environmental effects (e.g., rain, snow).
- Optimize performance and compatibility:
  - Profile the game code to identify bottlenecks and optimize performance.
  - Ensure compatibility with different operating systems and hardware configurations.
  - Address any memory leaks, performance issues, or compatibility issues encountered during testing.
- Expand documentation and community engagement:
  - Provide comprehensive documentation for developers, including setup instructions, usage guidelines, and code documentation.
  - Foster community engagement by encouraging contributions, addressing issues, and incorporating feedback from users.
  - Create tutorials, walkthroughs, and educational resources to help newcomers learn about game development and Pygame.
